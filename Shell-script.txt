
     ***************SHELL SCRIPT******************

jason(jq) install 
aws ec2 describe-vpcs | jq ".vpcs[].vpcid"
whenyou see the [] brackets in json format it is called list in list we have multiple components


file extension is .sh it recomended only for reference like it is a script file
	      file.sh
Below line is "SHEBANG LINE" in that file
			#!/bin/bash
shebang line means given commands will taken from /bin/bash/

you can execute some ways like
bash file.sh (you can execute without permissions) 
./file.sh    (it will works only for executable permissions requires)

when you give single quotes it will prints as it is you given
A=10
echo 'This is sunil $A'     ===> when you give this   
This is sunil $A          ===> it will prints like this 


when you given double quotes it will consider a variables also
A=10
echo "This is sunil $A"    ===> when you give this   
This is sunil 10           ===> it will prints like this
Types to declare 
	A=10
	 echo $A
	 echo ${A}
	 echo "${A}"
	 echo $A && echo ${A} && echo "${A}"

In jason format when you see squre brackets [] between the that brackets are list 

	# aws describe-vpcs | jq ".Vpcs[] .VpcId"
The above command will shows vpc id's
ex:
"vpc-fuhbvoq8w374rq38y4fg7q3bv" 
"vpc-7834tfbv97uybr3vnoicr7uh3c"

	# aws describe-vpcs | jq ".Vpcs[] .VpcId" -r
ex: -r removes double quotes
vpc-fuhbvoq8w374rq38y4fg7q3bv 
vpc-7834tfbv97uybr3vnoicr7uh3c

now we can make a new variable like A=10
	# VPCS=$(aws describe-vpcs | jq ".Vpcs[] .VpcId" -r)

now you can type only
	# echo $VPCS
ex:
vpc-fuhbvoq8w374rq38y4fg7q3bv 
vpc-7834tfbv97uybr3vnoicr7uh3c


environment variables 

directory level variables
